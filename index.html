<h3>A Short Paragraph About Coffee</h3>
<div class="music">
<p id="block1">		  	
Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.<br><br>

From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: Unroasted green coffee. <br><br>

<span class="special-words">The seeds are then roasted,</span> a process which transforms them into a consumable product: Roasted coffee, which is ground into a powder and typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.To learn more about coffee.

<p id="block2">
Coffee has a number of classifications used to determine the participation of growers (or the supply chain) in various combinations of social, environmental, and economic standards.<br><br>
				  													
Coffees fitting such categories and that are independently certified or verified by an accredited third party have been collectively termed <span class="special-words">
"sustainable coffees"</span>.<br><br>

This term has entered the lexicon and this segment has quickly grown into a multibillion-dollar industry of its own with potentially significant implications for other commodities as demand and awareness expand.

				<h3 id="heading_3">A World Of Coffee</h3>
<div class="music">
<p id="block3">First, in order to talk about the first coffee grinders, it makes sense to talk about the origin of coffee.<br><br>
								
Have a look at this cool map of the world in the form of coffee beans, where it shows the two main types of beans, Robusta (in red) and Arabica (in green). <br><br>
								
This map is basically a creative interpretation of the “Coffee Belt”, which indicates where coffee currently is grown, but it also sheds some light on its origins as well – which is to say, Africa, and more specifically – Ethiopia.

    <h3 id="heading_4"> History of Coffee Grinder</h3>
    
<div class="music">    
<p id="block4">
The first spice grinder was invented in the fifteenth century by either the Turkish people or the Persians – there is still some debate over this. <br><br>

The Turks, like the Ethiopians, treat coffee with a huge amount of respect. <br><br>

Coffee is involved in their day-to-day life in a very close way,it even finds its way into their wedding ceremonies and many other events.
